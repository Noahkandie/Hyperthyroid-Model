# Hypothyroidism-Detection-Model

Machine Learning Independent Project
# a) Specifying the Data Analytic Question

To build a model that determines whether or not the patient's symptoms indicate that the patient has hypothyroid.
# b) Defining the Metric for Success

The project will be a success if we are able to create a model that will accurately determine whether or not a patient symptoms indicate that the patient has hypothyroid. We will use accuracy score, confusion matrix, mse as the metrics for testing perfomance of our models
# c) Understanding the context

Hypothyroidism is a condition in which the thyroid gland is not able to produce enough thyroid hormone. Hypothyroidism is tested using personal and family history, Physical examinations and blood tests.

Physical Examinationâ€”Looking for Signs of Hypothyroidism which include:

Evidence of dry skin,Swelling around the eyes and legs, Slower reflexes, Slower heart rate

Blood Tests: Hypothyroidism can be detected by different blood tests.

TSH Test. A thyroid-stimulating hormone or TSH is a blood test that measures the amount of T4 (thyroxine) that the thyroid is being signaled to make. If you have an abnormally high level of TSH, it could mean you have hypothyroidism. T4 (thyroxine) Test. The thyroid gland produces T4 (thyroxine). The free T4 and the free T4 index are blood tests that, in combination with a TSH test, can let your physician know how your thyroid is functioning.
# d) Experimental design taken

In this study, we will be conducting Exploratory Data Analysis to study the relationships between the different variables. Later we will create a number of models to try find the most accurate model to predict hypothyroidism
# e) Data Relevance

Nairobi Hospital conducted a clinical camp to test for hypothyroidism.The data provided focuses on the findings of the camp.
